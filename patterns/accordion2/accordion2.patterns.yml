# This is the unique pattern ID.
#
# It is possible to define multiple patterns in a YML file, each with it's own
# unique ID. However, I personally think that it is more logical to have one
# pattern per file to keep them well-separated and organized.
#
# You can however, group similar patterns in a file.
# Example:
#   - button
#   - button_with_icon
#
accordion2:
  # The label and description are used in the Drupal UI and the pattern library.
  label: "Accordion 2 Item"
  description: "The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/docs/componenti/accordion/"

  # Fields of data supported by the pattern.
  # This can include optional fields which you can handle in your TWIG.
  fields:
    accordion_title:
      type: text
      label: 'Accordion title (field)'
      description: 'Accordion title.'
      preview: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
    accordion_content:
      type: text
      label: 'Accordion content (fields)'
      description: 'Accordion content'
      preview: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod temporâ€¦'
